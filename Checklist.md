## Release steps

* Build the code, test the image.
* If all tests passed, tag the commit with the version number.
* Build the code for all languages.
* Write the release notes in `AnduinOS-Docs` repo.
* Copy the image and the hash to the server. Verify the hash on the server.
* Update the `AnduinOS-Home` repo with the new version number. (Both `versions.json` and `index.html`.)
* Write the upgrade script for OTA updates in `AnduinOS` repo.
* Copy the OSS software lists.

## Helpfull commands

To rename the built binary to release format:

```bash
for file in AnduinOS-1.0.1-*{.iso,.sha256}; do mv "$file" "$(echo "$file" | sed -E 's/-[0-9]{10}//')"; done
```

To check the checksums of all .iso files and their corresponding .sha256 files:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Find all .iso files and their corresponding .sha256 files, including subdirectories
find . -type f -name "*.iso" | while read -r iso_file; do
    # Get the corresponding .sha256 file in the same directory
    sha256_file="${iso_file%.iso}.sha256"

    # Check if the .sha256 file exists
    if [[ -f "$sha256_file" ]]; then
        # Read the expected checksum from the .sha256 file and strip the 'SHA256: ' prefix
        expected_checksum=$(cat "$sha256_file" | sed 's/^SHA256: //')

        # Calculate the checksum of the .iso file
        actual_checksum=$(sha256sum "$iso_file" | awk '{ print $1 }')

        # Compare the checksums
        if [[ "$expected_checksum" == "$actual_checksum" ]]; then
            echo "Checksum for $iso_file matches."
        else
            echo "Checksum for $iso_file does not match!"
            echo "Expected: $expected_checksum"
            echo "Actual:   $actual_checksum"
        fi
    else
        echo "SHA256 file for $iso_file not found!"
    fi
done
```
